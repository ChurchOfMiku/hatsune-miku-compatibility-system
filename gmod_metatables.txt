This information comes mainly from dinking around in Gmod. Take it with several grains of salt.

Entity tables are accessed by calling ENT:GetTable(). These tables are built by merging prototypes rather than using index chains.

Entities also have a __newindex method defined in C.

Metatables contain:
- MetaID = the type id
- MetaName = the pretty name of the class
- MetaBaseClass = the parent classes metatable, or nil
