This information comes mainly from dinking around in Gmod. Take it with several grains of salt.

Some metamathods can be found at:

Most userdata's keys are accessed by calling X:GetTable(). These tables seem to mostly be built by merging prototypes together rather than by using metamethods.

At the moment Miku does NOT try to emulate this behavior perfectly, and uses alternative methods. A better effort might be made to emulate this behavior in the future, if and when it becomes a problem.
